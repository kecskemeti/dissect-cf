This package represents the DIScrete event baSed Energy Consumption simulaTor
for Clouds and Federations (DISSECT-CF).

It is intended as a lightweight cloud simulator that enables easy customization
and experimentation. It was designed for research purposes only so researchers
could experiment with various internal cloud behavior changes without the need
to actually have one or even multiple cloud infrastructures at hand.

The development of DISSECT-CF started in MTA SZTAKI in 2012, major contirbutions
and design elements were incorporated at the University of Innsbruck.
