/**
 * The main non-time dependent event handling mechanism in DISSECT-CF. This

 * as an embedded object. It is expected that the user of this class will want
 * to deliver notifications about its internal state changes. The kind of state
 * changes possible are not known by this generic mechanism, but the user of
 * this class is expected to express this via the generic parameter of the
 * class.
 * 
 * The individual notifications can be customized via the class's constructor.
