/**
 * This iterator alters the restart operator so it no longer resets the pointer
 * of the PM iterator but instead it marks the last PM encountered during the
 * previous iteration. This ensures that the first next operation of the new
 * iteration cycle will continue just as it would be the next operation of the
 * last iteration cycle.
 * 
 * <i>NOTE:</i> this iterator allows the index to overflow (i.e., to point over
 * the last element of the list). To handle these cases the iterator overwrites
 * the index dependent operations of PM Iterator.
