/**
 * Provides a scheduler that uses the round robin PM iterator to traverse
 * through the IaaS's running machines list. This ensures uniform use of the PMs
 * on the long run. Other than the random PM selection this class utilizes the
 * FirstFitScheduler's logic of VM placement and queue management.
 * 
 * Unless VM migration is used to reduce the PMs under utilization this
 * scheduler is less energy efficient than the generic first fit as that is
 * always trying to exhaust the resources of a PM before going for another one.
