/**
 * Allows an alterable resource constraints object to be propagated as
 * unalterable. It forwards all data read requests to the encapsulated object.
 * 
 * WARNING: this class does not make a copy of the original state of the
 * alterable resource constraints. Thus allows the reduction of new object
 * creations. Users of this class are expected to know that queries of on its
 * interface are not guaranteed to return the same value between two calls
 * (unlike constant constraints).
 * 
 * 
 * This class is intentionally non mutable, allowing those users (e.g. the class
 * of IaaSService or Scheduler) who would want to share their current capacities
 * not to create a new instance for every new query.
