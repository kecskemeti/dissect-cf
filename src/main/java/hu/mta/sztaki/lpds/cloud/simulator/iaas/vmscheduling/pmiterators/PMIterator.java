/**
 * Provides the archetype of PM iterators.
 * 
 * This iterator allows the user to get from the very first PM to the last one
 * in the PM list.
 * 
 * The iterator also allows to repeatedly use the same list for multiple times.
 * This is accomplished by the reset function which sets the iterator to its
 * starting position. The implementation of all iterators assume that after the
 * reset function is called there will be no change in the over seen PM list -
 * e.g., while calling the next function there are no cases when the PM list
 * gets new PMs.
