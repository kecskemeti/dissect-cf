/**
 * This is the base class for the simulation, every class that should receive
 * timing events should extend this and implement the function named "tick".
 * 
 * Tick is also used as the smallest discrete increase in time and it is user
 * defined.
 * 
 * <b>IMPORTANT:</b> How long an actual tick takes is left for the simulator's
 * user. The simulator expects every time dependent operation and constant to be
 * based on ticks used here. E.g., if you define the outgoing network bandwidth
 * of a networknode then you should set it in bytes/tick. Thus if your tick=ms
 * you must set it in bytes/ms.
